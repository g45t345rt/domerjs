## domerjs

Create small to big applications while keeping every logic inside declative objects.

domerjs is essentially just a bunch of helper functions for creating declarative user interfaces. It forces you to write code while decoupling the HTML hierarchy tree. I personnaly think it organized you code without really thinking about it.

**It does not implement any virtual DOM.**  
For Server Side Rendering you need to use JSDOM.
